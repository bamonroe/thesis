Note 14: It should be y = 1, but I've added a sentence to reiterate that this means the optimal choice is selected.
Note 15: It's correct in the thesis. The formula from page 638 of Hey (1995). If alpha is negative, the term inside the exponential is negative. The more negative an exponent the smaller the result.
Note 17: b is greater than or equal to a because a and b are indices. When b > a, it means that lottery a is preferred to b. This is why Pr(y=1) is the notation for the probability that the option with the greatest utility is chosen.
Note 18: No, it should be positive. A positive amount forgone indicates that something wasn't optimal, whereas a negative amount forgone would indicate a surplus.

a: I think I'd rather keep "Expected Utility Theory". I think it's more specific and what Grether & Plott were actually talking about.
e: I'd rather keep the notation of L&S.
k.iii : Same as "a" above.
n: I'm not sure what the note is here. 
o. Yes, same as Note 17 from Dr. Lau
q: This special case is coded into the ML function I used. The issue with the (0.99, 1.01) interval isn't that the CRRA function is undefined mathematically at 1, it's that for r approaching 1 the CRRA function approaches positive and negative infinity depending on the side of approach. This can result in numerical overflow problems with modern computers. I could do a small paper on why you're likely better off trashing estimates in this interval than believing them.
s: I did not.

pg 108: I can't find the copy of "Research in Experimetnal Economics" that has this citation. I've put the Braga paper in there though.
Regarding the several notes concerning the mixture models, I footnoted that the formulation I'm using follows Harrison & Rutstrom (2009) and allows for every observation to be generated by any model in the mixture.
